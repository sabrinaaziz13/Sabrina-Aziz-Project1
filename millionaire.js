// WORD TRIVIA

// ** Rules of the game**

// The game WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE is a series of multiple-choice questions that each have four possible answers (a, b, c, d). The contestant must answer 10 of these questions correctly, one at a time, in order to win the million dollars.

// If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, the game is over and they are thrown into a pit of fire. The winner decides that if they want to live, they must sign an NDA or else... (they also get thrown into a pit of fire).

// If they sign the NDA, they get to live, gets a one way plane ticket home from the secret island and two suitcases full of cash. The thing is the suitcases only unlock when they reach their final destination. Either one million dollars.
