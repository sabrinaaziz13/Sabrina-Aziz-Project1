** Rules of the game**

The game WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE is a series of multiple-choice questions that each have four possible answers (a, b, c, d). The contestant must answer 10 of these questions correctly, one at a time, in order to win the million dollars. Their bank is awarded one hundred thousand dollars after the completion of each round.

If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, the game is over and they are thrown into a pit of fire. The winner decides that if they want to live, they must sign an NDA or else... (they also get thrown into a pit of fire).

If they sign the NDA, they get to live, they get a one way plane ticket home from the secret island and two suitcases full of cash. The thing is the suitcases only unlock when they reach their final destination. // here just include a simple image or emoji of "nda" "plane" "money."

//I've been watching a lot of movies and shows soooooo.... (think squid games)

There would be 10 different categories for each round. Each question would have a set of (one) truth and (3) false values.

If the answer is false, the game is over and they would be launched out of their chairs into a pit of fire. For effects I think we can just have an image of a volcano. (think tic tac toe when Eric set the X's on a timer. Just do that with an image)

If the answer is true, they proceed to move on to the next round until they either lose or win the round. If all 10 rounds are complete, they get to go home... with the exceptions above. (i.e signing the NDA)

If they refuse to sign the NDA, they will be thrown into the pit of fire.

If they win, sign the NDA, they take their suitcases full of cash home.

If they decide to break the agreement of the NDA, then a family member would be abducted and be placed in the WWTBAM chair....(maybe but we dont need to work this out)

Ideally there would be a numerous bank of questions and answers.

the css for the game would look similar to WWTBAM game design.
